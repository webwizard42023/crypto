# REDUCING GAS FEES AND IMPROVE TRANSACTION IN ETHERUM 

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing Ethereum transactions by implementing two key strategies:

1. **Layer 2 Scaling Solutions:** In an effort to reduce gas fees and enhance transaction throughput, we have integrated Layer 2 scaling solutions, including Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups. These solutions efficiently offload transaction processing from the main Ethereum chain, resulting in a significant reduction in gas fees for users. Additionally, this implementation improves overall transaction speed, ensuring a more seamless experience for Ethereum users.

2. **Transaction Batching:** To further optimize gas consumption and minimize transaction costs for users, we have introduced transaction batching mechanisms. This approach allows us to bundle multiple transactions into a single transaction, significantly reducing the overall cost associated with executing these transactions. By optimizing gas consumption, we aim to provide a cost-effective solution for Ethereum users, making it more accessible and efficient to perform multiple transactions on the Ethereum network.
